	'When your mood falls, your mind weakens and finally breaks. Do not forget, it is difficult for a normal man to come to terms with the fact that he is now a woman. In order to keep your mood and psyche at an acceptable level make sure you are of healthy weight, have at least a TV and visit the psychotherapist. Strengthening your will and intellect also increases the maximum value of your mood, such that the harmful effects will not be as devastating.'
