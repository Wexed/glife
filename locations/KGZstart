	'As harsh and merciless this world. Not that past life was better or worse. All its advantages and disadvantages. You were probably wondering, what kind of a zombie apocalypse, there are pros? I´ll tell you ... Freedom. Freedom of action and freedom of choice, everyone is free to do what really wants. For me, the beginning of the end of the world, was liberation. And even now, I realize that I was only here because of their choice, their freedom.'
	'In a past life I was an ordinary man:he went to work, met a girl, paying loans and was going to fly on vacation at some resort. On a day when everything changed, I woke up surprisingly early, the sun´s rays coming through the curtains and joyfully heralded a new day, and with it the complete collapse of the old society.'
	'My girl was not there, then I thought that she had gone to work early. How wrong I was. To my surprise, the apartment was not the light, and I put the coffee brewed in the old. Normally I do not have time to watch it, but that day I decided not to rush to work, and simply enjoy the morning. Fire a couple of balls, said that it would be necessary to go to the grocery store and absorb rather take breakfast and read long deferred detective.'
	'My peace interrupted some noise outside the front door. I heard heart-rending cries, which ended after a few seconds. Still not understanding what was happening, I grabbed the phone and quickly dialed 911. As the tube was silence, frightening and ruthless, no beeps, no sound at all, just my own echo was given in the endless corridors of radio waves.'
